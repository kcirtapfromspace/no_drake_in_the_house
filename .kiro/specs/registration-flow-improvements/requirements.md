# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical improvements to the existing user registration flow in No Drake in the House. The current registration system has several inconsistencies and missing features that impact both developer experience and user experience. Specifically, there's a mismatch between API documentation and implementation, missing server-side validation for password confirmation and terms acceptance, and lack of seamless auto-login after successful registration.

The goal is to create a robust, consistent registration experience that aligns documentation with implementation, provides proper server-side validation, and delivers a smooth user onboarding flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Documentation and Implementation Alignment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API documentation to accurately reflect the actual implementation, so that I can integrate with the registration endpoint without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the API documentation THEN it SHALL accurately describe the current RegisterRequest structure containing only email and password fields
2. WHEN the API documentation describes optional fields THEN those fields SHALL be implemented in the actual API or removed from documentation
3. WHEN developers reference the authentication.md documentation THEN it SHALL provide accurate examples of request/response payloads
4. WHEN API changes are made THEN the documentation SHALL be updated simultaneously to maintain consistency
5. IF there are discrepancies between docs and implementation THEN they SHALL be identified and resolved within this specification

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Server-Side Registration Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the server to validate my password confirmation and terms acceptance, so that I have confidence in the security and completeness of my registration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits registration with password and confirm_password THEN the server SHALL verify that both passwords match exactly
2. WHEN a user submits registration without accepting terms THEN the server SHALL reject the request with a clear error message
3. WHEN password confirmation fails THEN the server SHALL return a specific error indicating password mismatch
4. WHEN terms are not accepted THEN the server SHALL return a specific error requiring terms acceptance
5. IF server-side validation fails THEN the response SHALL include field-specific error messages for client-side display

### Requirement 3: Seamless Auto-Login After Registration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be automatically logged in after successful registration, so that I can immediately start using the platform without additional steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registration completes successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate the user and return access and refresh tokens
2. WHEN auto-login occurs THEN the frontend SHALL store the tokens and update the authentication state immediately
3. WHEN the user is auto-logged in THEN they SHALL be redirected to the main dashboard or onboarding flow
4. WHEN auto-login fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to displaying a success message with manual login prompt
5. IF the user prefers manual login THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration option to disable auto-login

### Requirement 4: Improved Registration Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear, specific error messages when registration fails, so that I can understand and fix any issues with my registration attempt.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registration fails due to existing email THEN the system SHALL return a specific "Email already registered" error message
2. WHEN registration fails due to password requirements THEN the system SHALL return detailed password criteria that weren't met
3. WHEN registration fails due to server errors THEN the system SHALL return user-friendly error messages without exposing internal details
4. WHEN multiple validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return all relevant errors in a structured format
5. IF network errors occur THEN the frontend SHALL display appropriate retry options and offline handling

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Frontend Registration Form

**User Story:** As a user, I want a polished registration form with real-time validation and clear feedback, so that I can complete registration efficiently and confidently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN typing in form fields THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation feedback for email format and password strength
2. WHEN password confirmation doesn't match THEN the system SHALL immediately highlight the mismatch with clear messaging
3. WHEN terms checkbox is required THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this requirement and prevent submission until checked
4. WHEN form submission is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading states and disable multiple submissions
5. IF registration succeeds THEN the system SHALL show success feedback before redirecting to the authenticated experience

### Requirement 6: Registration Security Enhancements

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the registration process to follow security best practices, so that my account is protected from the moment of creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN passwords are processed THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum security requirements (length, complexity, common password checks)
2. WHEN registration requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. WHEN user data is stored THEN passwords SHALL be hashed using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds (minimum 12)
4. WHEN registration completes THEN the system SHALL log the event for security auditing without storing sensitive data
5. IF suspicious registration patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL implement additional verification steps

### Requirement 7: Registration Flow Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for the registration flow, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registration tests run THEN they SHALL cover all validation scenarios including success and failure cases
2. WHEN testing password confirmation THEN tests SHALL verify both matching and non-matching password scenarios
3. WHEN testing terms acceptance THEN tests SHALL verify both accepted and rejected terms scenarios
4. WHEN testing auto-login THEN tests SHALL verify token generation, storage, and authentication state updates
5. IF registration logic changes THEN existing tests SHALL continue to pass or be updated to reflect new requirements

### Requirement 8: Registration Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want registration to be fast and reliable, so that I can quickly create my account and start using the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting registration THEN the system SHALL complete the process within 2 seconds under normal load
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use transactions to ensure data consistency
3. WHEN registration fails partway through THEN the system SHALL not leave partial user records in the database
4. WHEN high load occurs THEN the registration system SHALL maintain responsiveness and provide appropriate feedback
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN registration SHALL gracefully degrade with clear user communication
