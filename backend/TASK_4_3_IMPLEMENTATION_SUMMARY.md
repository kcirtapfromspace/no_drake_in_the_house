# Task 4.3 Implementation Summary: Spotify Enforcement Execution Engine

## Overview
Task 4.3 has been successfully implemented with a comprehensive Spotify enforcement execution engine that provides batch operations, idempotent handling, detailed action logging, and rollback capabilities. The implementation builds upon the library analysis and planning service from Task 4.2 to execute enforcement actions safely and efficiently.

## Implementation Details

### ✅ 1. Batch Operations for Library Modifications
**Location:** `backend/src/services/spotify_enforcement.rs`

- **Batch Processing:** Groups actions by type for optimal API usage (up to 50 items per batch)
- **Liked Songs Removal:** Batch removal of up to 50 tracks at once using Spotify's batch API
- **Playlist Track Removal:** Delta removal optimization to minimize API calls per playlist
- **Artist Unfollowing:** Batch unfollowing of up to 50 artists simultaneously
- **Album Removal:** Batch removal of saved albums with proper error handling

**Key Features:**
```rust
async fn execute_liked_songs_batch(&self, connection: &Connection, actions: Vec<ActionItem>) -> Result<()> {
    const BATCH_SIZE: usize = 50; // Spotify's maximum batch size
    
    for chunk in actions.chunks(BATCH_SIZE) {
        let track_ids: Vec<String> = chunk.iter().map(|a| a.entity_id.clone()).collect();
        self.wait_for_rate_limit().await?;
        
        match self.remove_liked_songs_batch(connection, &track_ids).await {
            Ok(_) => { /* Mark all actions as completed */ }
            Err(e) => { /* Mark all actions as failed */ }
        }
    }
}
```

### ✅ 2. Playlist Scrubbing with Delta Removal
**Location:** `backend/src/services/spotify_enforcement.rs`

- **Delta Optimization:** Groups playlist track removals by playlist to minimize API calls
- **Snapshot Tracking:** Tracks playlist snapshot IDs for consistency and rollback
- **Batch Track Removal:** Removes multiple tracks from a playlist in a single API call
- **Error Isolation:** Failures in one playlist don't affect others

**Delta Removal Implementation:**
```rust
async fn execute_playlist_tracks_batch(&self, connection: &Connection, actions: Vec<ActionItem>) -> Result<()> {
    // Group by playlist for delta removal
    let mut playlist_groups: HashMap<String, Vec<ActionItem>> = HashMap::new();
    
    for action in actions {
        if let Some(playlist_id) = action.before_state.get("playlist_id") {
            playlist_groups.entry(playlist_id.to_string()).or_default().push(action);
        }
    }

    for (playlist_id, playlist_actions) in playlist_groups {
        let tracks_to_remove: Vec<Value> = playlist_actions
            .iter()
            .map(|action| json!({"uri": format!("spotify:track:{}", action.entity_id)}))
            .collect();

        match self.remove_playlist_tracks_batch(connection, &playlist_id, &tracks_to_remove).await {
            Ok(snapshot_id) => { /* Update all actions with new snapshot */ }
            Err(e) => { /* Mark all actions as failed */ }
        }
    }
}
```

### ✅ 3. Idempotent Operation Handling
**Location:** `backend/src/models/action.rs`

- **Idempotency Keys:** Automatic generation based on batch_id, entity_type, entity_id, and action
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Database constraints prevent duplicate operations
- **Batch-Level Idempotency:** Entire batches can be safely retried using batch idempotency keys
- **Action-Level Idempotency:** Individual actions within batches are idempotent

**Idempotency Implementation:**
```rust
impl ActionItem {
    pub fn new(batch_id: Uuid, entity_type: String, entity_id: String, action: String, before_state: Option<serde_json::Value>) -> Self {
        let idempotency_key = format!("{}_{}_{}_{}", batch_id, entity_type, entity_id, action);
        
        Self {
            id: Uuid::new_v4(),
            batch_id,
            entity_type,
            entity_id,
            action,
            idempotency_key: Some(idempotency_key),
            before_state,
            after_state: None,
            status: ActionItemStatus::Pending,
            error_message: None,
            created_at: Utc::now(),
        }
    }
}
```

### ✅ 4. Detailed Action Logging and Rollback Capabilities
**Location:** `backend/src/models/action.rs` and `backend/src/services/spotify_enforcement.rs`

- **Comprehensive Logging:** Every action logs before_state, after_state, timestamps, and metadata
- **Batch Tracking:** Complete audit trail of batch execution with summaries and error details
- **Rollback Support:** Actions can be rolled back if they have before_state information
- **Partial Rollback:** Support for rolling back specific actions within a batch
- **Error Classification:** Distinguishes between recoverable and non-recoverable errors

**Rollback Implementation:**
```rust
pub async fn rollback_batch(&self, connection: &Connection, request: RollbackBatchRequest) -> Result<RollbackInfo> {
    let batch = self.get_batch(&request.batch_id).await?
        .ok_or_else(|| anyhow!("Batch not found"))?;

    // Get actions to rollback
    let actions_to_rollback = if let Some(action_ids) = request.action_ids {
        self.get_batch_actions_by_ids(&action_ids).await?
    } else {
        self.get_batch_actions(&batch.id, Some(ActionItemStatus::Completed)).await?
    };

    // Create rollback batch and execute reverse operations
    let rollback_batch = ActionBatch::new(/* rollback parameters */);
    
    for original_action in actions_to_rollback {
        if original_action.can_rollback() {
            let rollback_action = self.create_rollback_action(&rollback_batch.id, &original_action)?;
            self.execute_rollback_action(connection, rollback_action).await?;
        }
    }
}
```
