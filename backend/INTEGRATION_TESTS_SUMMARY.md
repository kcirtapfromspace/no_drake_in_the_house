**Concurrent User Operations:**
- Multiple users performing operations simultaneously
- Resource contention handling
- Performance under load

### 3. Contract Tests (`contract_tests.rs`)

**Spotify API Contract Changes:**
- Missing fields detection
- Changed field names
- Data type modifications
- Additional required fields
- Error response format changes

**Apple Music API Contract Changes:**
- Data structure modifications
- Attribute name changes
- Additional metadata handling

**MusicBrainz API Contract Changes:**
- Artist data structure changes
- Score field type variations

- Optional field removal

**HTTP Protocol Changes:**
- Status code handling (200, 201, 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500, 502, 503)
- Content type variations
- Rate limit header formats
- Pagination format differences

### 4. Browser Extension Integration Tests (`browser_extension_integration_tests.rs`)

**Content Filtering with DOM Fixtures:**
- Realistic DOM structures for Spotify, YouTube Music, Apple Music, Tidal
- Artist detection across different selector strategies
- Content hiding simulation
- Selector resilience testing

**Bloom Filter Performance:**
- O(1) lookup performance with 10,000 lookups in <10ms
- False positive rate validation (<5%)
- Memory usage optimization

**Auto-Skip Functionality:**
- Media event handling
- Track detection and skipping
- User override controls
- Performance timing validation

**Offline Functionality:**
- Cached DNP list operation
- Server sync failure handling
- Stale cache detection
- Graceful degradation

**Selector Resilience:**
- DOM structure changes adaptation
- Class name modifications
- Attribute changes handling
- Content modifications tolerance
- 70%+ detection rate maintenance after changes

**Performance Under Load:**
- 1000+ elements/second processing
- Memory usage optimization (<10MB for 10k artists)
- Heavy DOM mutation handling

### 5. Simplified Integration Tests (`simplified_integration_tests.rs`)

**API Integration Flows:**
- Spotify API complete flow (OAuth → Profile → Library)
- Apple Music API flow (Storefront → Library)
- MusicBrainz API integration with proper rate limiting

**Error Handling:**
- Rate limiting (429 responses)
- Server errors (500, 502, 503)
- Network timeouts
- Authentication failures

**Concurrent Operations:**
- Multiple simultaneous API requests
- Resource sharing and contention
- Performance validation

**Contract Validation:**
- Response format validation
- Required field checking
- Additional field tolerance
- Error format consistency

### 6. Test Infrastructure

**Integration Test Runner (`integration_test_runner.rs`):**
- Comprehensive test orchestration
- Timeout handling
- Result aggregation and reporting
- Database and Redis setup utilities
- Test environment configuration

**Test Configuration (`test_config.rs`):**
- Environment-based configuration
- Database and Redis setup
- External API test toggles
- Performance test controls

**Performance Benchmarks (`integration_benchmarks.rs`):**
- Bloom filter performance benchmarking
- Entity resolution concurrent processing
- Enforcement planning performance
- Database operation batching
- API rate limiting compliance
- Extension content filtering speed
- Concurrent user operation scaling

### 7. Key Features Tested

### 10. Implementation Status

**Task 11.2 Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

The integration test suite provides comprehensive coverage of:
- Real API integrations with mock servers
- Contract validation for external API changes
- Complete end-to-end user workflows
- Browser extension functionality with realistic DOM fixtures
- Performance benchmarking and optimization validation
