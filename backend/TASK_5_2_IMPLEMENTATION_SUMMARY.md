# Task 5.2 Implementation Summary: Build Community List Subscription System

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive community list subscription system with governance requirements, version pinning, impact preview, and notification capabilities. The system provides robust community-driven curation with proper moderation and appeals processes.

## Implementation Details

### Community List Creation with Governance ✅

#### Core Features
- **Location**: `backend/src/services/community_list.rs::create_community_list()`
- **Governance Requirements**:
  - Mandatory neutral criteria validation
  - Required governance URL for transparency
  - Update cadence specification (weekly, monthly, as-needed)
  - Visibility controls (public, private, unlisted)
- **Content Policy Enforcement**:
  - Automated detection of prohibited language patterns
  - Neutral criteria requirement to prevent bias
  - Structured appeals process for disputes
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/community/lists`

#### Validation System
```rust
fn validate_neutral_criteria(&self, criteria: &str) -> Result<()> {
    let prohibited_patterns = [
        r"\b(accused|alleged|guilty)\b",
        r"\b(criminal|illegal|lawsuit)\b", 
        r"\b(bad|evil|terrible)\s+(person|artist)\b",
    ];
    // Prevents judgmental language in community lists
}
```

### List Subscription and Version Pinning ✅

#### Subscription Management
- **Location**: `backend/src/services/community_list.rs::subscribe_to_community_list()`
- **Features**:
  - Version pinning for reproducible results
  - Auto-update toggle for list changes
  - Subscription conflict detection
  - Flexible subscription settings
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/community/lists/:list_id/subscribe`
  - `POST /api/v1/community/lists/:list_id/unsubscribe`
  - `PUT /api/v1/community/lists/:list_id/subscription`

#### Version Control System
- Immutable versioning for community lists
- Automatic version increment on list modifications
- Version-specific subscription pinning
- Change tracking for audit trails

### Impact Preview System ✅

#### Subscription Impact Analysis
- **Location**: `backend/src/services/community_list.rs::get_subscription_impact_preview()`

  - Provider-specific impact estimation
  - Sample artist preview (first 10 new artists)
  - Library size impact projections
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/community/lists/:list_id/impact`

#### Impact Metrics
```rust
pub struct SubscriptionImpactPreview {
    pub total_artists_in_list: usize,
    pub new_artists_for_user: usize,
    pub already_blocked_artists: usize,
    pub impact_by_provider: Vec<ProviderImpact>,

- **API Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/community/lists`

#### Privacy Protection
- Email masking for user privacy (`us**@example.com`)
- Public visibility controls
- Owner information protection

### Notification System for Updates ✅

#### Update Tracking
- **Database Schema**: Version-based change tracking
- **Features**:
  - Automatic version increment on modifications
  - Change diff calculation for notifications
  - Subscriber notification queuing
  - Update cadence enforcement
- **Data Models**: `CommunityListUpdateNotification`, `CommunityListChanges`

#### Notification Structure
```rust
pub struct CommunityListUpdateNotification {
    pub list_id: Uuid,
    pub list_name: String,
    pub old_version: i32,
    pub new_version: i32,
    pub changes: CommunityListChanges,
    pub updated_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

CREATE TABLE community_lists (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    owner_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    criteria TEXT NOT NULL, -- Required neutral criteria
    governance_url TEXT, -- Link to governance process
    update_cadence TEXT, -- "weekly", "monthly", "as-needed"
    version INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    visibility VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'public',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Community list items
CREATE TABLE community_list_items (
    list_id UUID REFERENCES community_lists(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    artist_id UUID REFERENCES artists(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    rationale_link TEXT,
    added_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (list_id, artist_id)
);

-- User subscriptions with version pinning
CREATE TABLE user_list_subscriptions (
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    list_id UUID REFERENCES community_lists(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    version_pinned INTEGER,
    auto_update BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, list_id)
);
```
