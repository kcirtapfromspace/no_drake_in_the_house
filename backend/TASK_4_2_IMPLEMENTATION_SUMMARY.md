# Task 4.2 Implementation Summary: Spotify Library Analysis and Planning Service

## Overview
Task 4.2 has been successfully implemented with comprehensive Spotify library analysis capabilities, featured artist detection, and enforcement planning with dry-run impact calculation. The implementation provides a robust foundation for analyzing user libraries and creating detailed enforcement plans.

## Implementation Details

### ✅ 1. Spotify Library Scanning
**Location:** `backend/src/services/spotify_library.rs`

- **Complete Library Scanning:** `SpotifyLibraryService::scan_library()` scans all library components
- **Liked Songs:** Paginated scanning of user's saved tracks with full metadata
- **Playlists:** Complete playlist enumeration with track details and ownership information
- **Followed Artists:** Artist following relationships with metadata
- **Saved Albums:** User's saved album collection with artist information
- **Concurrent Processing:** All library components scanned concurrently for optimal performance

**Key Features:**
```rust
pub async fn scan_library(&self, connection: &Connection) -> Result<SpotifyLibrary> {
    let (liked_songs, playlists, followed_artists, saved_albums) = tokio::try_join!(
        self.scan_liked_songs(connection),
        self.scan_playlists(connection),
        self.scan_followed_artists(connection),
        self.scan_saved_albums(connection)
    )?;
    // Returns comprehensive library snapshot
}
```

### ✅ 2. Featured Artist Detection from Track Metadata
**Location:** `backend/src/services/spotify_library.rs`

- **Multi-Strategy Detection:** Uses multiple methods to identify featured artists and collaborations
- **Regex Pattern Matching:** Detects "feat.", "ft.", "featuring", "with", "&", "x" patterns in track titles
- **Artist Array Analysis:** Identifies collaborations from multiple artists in track metadata
- **Album vs Track Artist Comparison:** Detects featured artists by comparing album and track artists
- **Confidence Scoring:** Each detection method provides confidence scores (0.0-1.0)

**Detection Methods:**
```rust
pub enum DetectionMethod {
    TrackTitle,    // Detected from track title patterns
    ArtistArray,   // Multiple artists in the artists array
    AlbumArtist,   // Different from track artists
    Metadata,      // From additional metadata
}
```

**Pattern Examples:**
- "Song Title (feat. Artist Name)" → 90% confidence
- "Artist1 & Artist2 - Song" → 70% confidence
- Multiple artists in array → 70% confidence

### ✅ 3. Enforcement Planning with Dry-Run Impact Calculation
**Location:** `backend/src/services/spotify_library.rs`

- **Comprehensive Impact Analysis:** Analyzes impact across all library components
- **Dry-Run Calculations:** Shows exactly what would be affected without making changes
- **Aggressiveness Levels:** Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive enforcement options
- **Collaboration Handling:** Configurable blocking of collaborations and featuring
- **Detailed Action Planning:** Creates specific actions for each enforcement operation

**Impact Analysis:**
```rust
pub struct EnforcementImpact {
    pub liked_songs: LibraryImpact,      // Tracks to remove from liked songs
    pub playlists: PlaylistImpact,       // Playlist modifications needed
    pub followed_artists: FollowingImpact, // Artists to unfollow
    pub saved_albums: AlbumImpact,       // Albums to remove
    pub total_items_affected: u32,
    pub estimated_time_saved_hours: f64, // Listening time avoided
}
```

### ✅ 4. Collaboration and Featuring Detection Logic
**Location:** `backend/src/services/spotify_library.rs`

- **Smart Artist Parsing:** Parses featured artist names from track titles
- **Collaboration Detection:** Identifies collaborative tracks from artist arrays
- **Confidence-Based Filtering:** Uses confidence thresholds to avoid false positives
- **Configurable Blocking:** Options to block collaborations, featuring, or songwriter-only credits

**Detection Logic:**
```rust
fn should_block_track(&self, detection: &FeaturedArtistDetection, dnp_lookup: &HashMap<String, Uuid>, options: &EnforcementOptions) -> BlockResult {
    // Check primary artists (always block)
    // Check featured artists (if enabled)
    // Check collaboration artists (if enabled)
    // Apply aggressiveness level filtering
}
```

## Data Models

### Core Spotify Models
**Location:** `backend/src/models/spotify.rs`

- **SpotifyLibrary:** Complete user library representation
- **SpotifyTrack/Artist/Album/Playlist:** Full Spotify entity models
- **FeaturedArtistDetection:** Detection results with confidence scoring
- **EnforcementPlan:** Complete enforcement plan with actions and impact

### Enforcement Planning Models
```rust
pub struct EnforcementPlan {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub user_id: Uuid,
    pub provider: String,
    pub options: EnforcementOptions,
    pub dnp_artists: Vec<Uuid>,
    pub impact: EnforcementImpact,
    pub actions: Vec<PlannedAction>,
    pub estimated_duration_seconds: u32,
    pub idempotency_key: String,
}
```

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints Added
**Location:** `backend/src/main.rs`

1. **POST /api/v1/spotify/library/scan** - Scan user's complete Spotify library

## Featured Artist Detection Examples

### Pattern Recognition
- **"Song (feat. Artist)"** → DetectionMethod::TrackTitle, 90% confidence
- **"Artist1 & Artist2"** → DetectionMethod::ArtistArray, 70% confidence
- **Album artist ≠ Track artists** → DetectionMethod::AlbumArtist, 60% confidence

### Collaboration Detection
- **Multiple artists in track.artists array** → Collaboration detected
- **Featured artist parsing from title** → Featured artist detected
- **Confidence-based filtering** → Prevents false positives

## Performance Optimizations

### Concurrent Processing
- **Parallel Library Scanning:** All library components scanned concurrently
- **Batch API Requests:** Efficient pagination with optimal batch sizes
- **Rate Limit Compliance:** Respects Spotify API rate limits

### Memory Efficiency
- **Streaming Processing:** Processes large libraries without loading everything into memory
- **Selective Data Loading:** Only loads necessary metadata for analysis

## Testing

### Unit Tests
**Location:** `backend/src/services/spotify_library.rs`

- **Featured Artist Detection:** Tests pattern recognition and confidence scoring
- **Collaboration Detection:** Tests multi-artist track analysis
- **Mock Data Testing:** Uses realistic Spotify API response structures

### Test Coverage
