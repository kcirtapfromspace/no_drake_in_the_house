## Technical Implementation

### Artist Detection Strategies

1. **URL-based Detection** (Primary)
   ```javascript
   // Extract from Apple Music artist URLs
   if (element.href.includes('/artist/')) {
     const artistId = element.href.split('/artist/')[1]?.split('/')[0];
     // ...
   }
   ```

2. **DOM Structure Analysis**
   ```javascript
   // Track rows in song lists
   '.songs-list-row, .tracklist__item'
   
   // Artist cards in browse/search
   '.grid-item--artist, .artist-lockup'
   
   // Now playing controls
   '.web-chrome-playback-controls, .playback-controls'
   ```

3. **Text Content Parsing**
   ```javascript
   // Fallback for elements without direct links
   const artistText = element.querySelector('.songs-list-row__by-line');
   ```

### Visual Blocking Implementation

1. **Content Hiding**
   ```css
   .kiro-hidden {
     opacity: 0.3 !important;
     filter: grayscale(100%) !important;
     pointer-events: none !important;
   }
   ```

2. **Overlay System**
   - Shadow DOM isolation for UI components
   - Positioned overlays with user controls
   - Apple Music-styled interface elements

3. **Notification System**
   - Native-looking notifications
   - Action buttons for user interaction
   - Automatic dismissal with manual override

## User Experience

### What Users See

1. **Blocked Content Indicators**
   - Grayed-out artist cards and tracks
   - "üö´ Blocked" badges on content
   - Full-page overlays for artist pages

2. **Quick Action Menus**
   - "Show Once" - temporarily reveal content
   - "Unblock Artist" - remove from DNP list
   - "Block Permanently" - add to DNP list

3. **Informational Messages**
   - Capability limitations explained
   - Manual action instructions provided
   - Clear feedback on user actions

### Manual Actions Required

1. **Track Skipping**
   - User must manually click next/skip button
   - Extension shows notification when blocked track detected
   - No automatic playback control available

2. **Library Cleanup**
   - User must open Apple Music app
   - Manually remove blocked tracks/albums
   - Extension provides export of blocked content list

3. **Playlist Management**
   - User must edit playlists manually
   - Extension identifies blocked tracks
   - Manual removal required for each track

## Comparison with Other Platforms

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Detection**
   - Machine learning for better artist recognition
   - Featured artist detection in track titles
   - Collaboration detection from metadata

2. **Better User Experience**
   - Keyboard shortcuts for quick actions
   - Bulk operations for multiple tracks
   - Integration with Apple Music app (if API access improves)

3. **Export/Import Features**
   - Export blocked content lists
   - Import from other platforms
   - Sync with main Kiro service

### API Limitations

Apple Music's web API restrictions mean that many features available on other platforms cannot be implemented. These limitations are imposed by Apple and cannot be circumvented through the browser extension.

**Key Restrictions:**
- No programmatic playback control
- No library modification capabilities
- No playlist editing permissions
- Limited metadata access
- No recommendation algorithm access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Artist Not Detected**
   - Check if artist page has proper URL structure
   - Verify artist name spelling in DNP list
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Visual Blocking Not Working**
   - Ensure extension has proper permissions
   - Check if Apple Music updated their DOM structure
   - Verify content script is loaded

3. **Quick Actions Not Responding**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify connection to Kiro backend
   - Try reloading the page

### Reporting Issues

When reporting issues with Apple Music integration:

1. Include the specific Apple Music page URL
2. Describe the expected vs actual behavior
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Note if the issue occurs on other platforms

## Conclusion

While Apple Music's API limitations prevent full automation like other platforms, the visual blocking and detection capabilities provide significant value to users who want to avoid specific artists. The extension clearly communicates these limitations and provides the best possible experience within Apple's constraints.

Users should understand that manual action is required for most content management tasks, but the extension makes it easy to identify what needs to be removed and provides clear instructions for doing so.
