# Tiltfile Migration and Service Orchestration Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the Tiltfile configuration and service orchestration for the dev-environment-stabilization project, specifically addressing task 2: "Fix Tiltfile configuration and service orchestration".

## Changes Made

### 1. Proper Dependency Ordering

**Before**: Services started without proper dependency management, leading to race conditions and startup failures.

**After**: Implemented strict dependency chain:
```
postgres + redis (foundational services)
    ↓
database-migration (depends on postgres)
    ↓
backend (depends on postgres + redis + database-migration)
    ↓
frontend (depends on backend)
```

**Implementation**:
- Updated `k8s_resource` configurations with proper `resource_deps`
- Added `pod_readiness='wait'` for critical services
- Migration job runs automatically and must complete before backend starts

### 2. Automatic Migration Job Execution

**Before**: Migrations were handled inconsistently, leading to "relation does not exist" errors.

**After**: Robust automatic migration system:

**Migration Job Features**:
- Runs automatically on Tilt startup
- Uses proper SQLx migration table format
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Verifies all critical tables exist after migration
- Prevents backend startup if migrations fail

**Backend Integration**:
- `wait-for-migration` init container verifies migration completion
- Checks for required database tables before starting
- Provides detailed error messages on migration failures

### 3. Manual Seed Data Trigger

**Before**: No standardized way to load test data.

**After**: Comprehensive seed data system:

**Seed Job Features**:
- Suspended by default (`suspend: true`)
- Only runs when explicitly triggered via `db-seed` command
- Comprehensive test data including:
  - 3 test users with different roles
  - 5 test artists (Drake, Kanye West, Chris Brown, R. Kelly, Taylor Swift)
  - DNP entries and community lists
  - Test subscriptions and connections
- Automatically re-suspends after completion

**Manual Trigger**:
- `db-seed` trigger enables job, waits for completion, then re-suspends
- Checks for existing data to prevent duplicates
- Provides detailed status reporting

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling and Status Reporting

**Before**: Limited error information and difficult troubleshooting.

**After**: Comprehensive error handling system:

**Migration Error Handling**:
- Detailed logging with emojis for easy scanning
- Migration history tracking in `sqlx_migrations` table
- Clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance
- Timeout handling with proper cleanup

**Enhanced Manual Triggers**:

#### `db-migrate`
- Cleans up existing migration jobs
- Waits for completion with timeout
- Shows migration logs and status on failure
- Verifies database schema after completion

#### `db-seed`
- Verifies migration completion first
- Checks for existing data
- Provides comprehensive seed data summary
- Re-suspends job for future use

#### `db-reset`
- Safely stops backend before database reset
- Drops and recreates database
- Cleans up migration and seed jobs
- Restarts backend automatically

#### `db-status`
- Shows migration job status
- Displays migration history
- Verifies database schema
- Provides data summary

#### `health-check`
- Comprehensive service health verification
- Includes migration status
- Tests all service endpoints
- Provides troubleshooting guidance

#### `dev-setup`
- Step-by-step environment verification
- Waits for each service in proper order
- Tests service endpoints
- Provides next steps guidance

### 5. Improved Developer Experience

**Startup Information**:
- Clear service endpoints listing
- Available manual triggers with descriptions
- Quick start workflow guide
- Migration and database management guidance

**Enhanced Logging**:
- Structured output with emojis for easy scanning
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Clear success/failure indicators
- Troubleshooting guidance on failures

## Files Modified

### `Tiltfile`
- Updated resource dependency ordering
- Enhanced manual triggers with comprehensive error handling
- Improved startup information and developer guidance
- Added migration status verification to health checks

### `k8s/dev/migration-job.yaml`
- Simplified YAML structure to avoid parsing issues
- Robust migration script with SQLx compatibility
- Comprehensive seed data with realistic test scenarios
- Proper error handling and status reporting

### `scripts/test-migration-job.sh`
- New test script for isolated migration job testing
- Verifies migration job functionality
- Tests seed job integration
- Provides comprehensive status reporting

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 5.1: Automatic Service Deployment
✅ `tilt up` builds and deploys all services automatically with proper dependencies

### Requirement 5.2: Fast Rebuilds and Clear Status
✅ Code changes trigger fast rebuilds (existing live update preserved)
✅ Clear logs and status information for all operations

### Requirement 5.4: Clear Logs and Manual Triggers
✅ Comprehensive manual triggers for development workflow
✅ Clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2.1: Automatic Migration Execution
✅ Database migrations run automatically via Kubernetes Job before backend starts

### Requirement 2.3: Migration Error Handling
✅ Clear error messages and backend startup prevention on migration failure

## Usage

### Basic Workflow
1. Run `tilt up` - all services start with proper dependencies
2. Wait for migration job to complete automatically
3. Backend starts only after successful migration
4. Use `dev-setup` trigger to verify complete initialization
5. Optionally use `db-seed` to load test data

### Database Management
- `db-migrate`: Re-run migrations manually
- `db-seed`: Load comprehensive test data
- `db-reset`: Reset database and migration state
- `db-status`: Check migration history and database health

### Monitoring
- `health-check`: Comprehensive service health verification
- `service-status`: Kubernetes resource status
- Built-in Tilt UI shows real-time service status

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Proper dependency ordering prevents race conditions
2. **Developer Productivity**: Clear error messages and automated setup
3. **Consistency**: Standardized migration and seeding process
4. **Troubleshooting**: Comprehensive status reporting and guidance
5. **Flexibility**: Manual triggers for development workflow control

## Testing

The migration job functionality can be tested independently using:
```bash
./scripts/test-migration-job.sh
```

This script verifies:
- Migration job creation and execution
- Database schema verification
- Seed job integration (if available)
- Comprehensive status reporting
