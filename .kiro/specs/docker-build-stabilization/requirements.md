# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Docker build process for the frontend application is experiencing failures due to environment configuration issues, missing files, and build context problems. This feature will stabilize the Docker build environment to ensure consistent, reliable builds across development, staging, and production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Docker build process to handle missing environment files gracefully, so that builds don't fail due to configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker build process runs THEN it SHALL handle missing .env files without failing
2. WHEN environment variables are not provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults
3. WHEN building in different environments THEN the system SHALL adapt configuration appropriately
4. IF .env files are missing THEN the build SHALL continue with default values and log warnings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want TypeScript configuration to work correctly in Docker builds, so that the build process is consistent across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker build runs THEN TypeScript configuration SHALL be properly resolved
2. WHEN tsconfig.node.json is referenced THEN all required files SHALL be available in the build context
3. WHEN building in Docker THEN TypeScript compilation SHALL succeed without path resolution errors
4. IF TypeScript warnings occur THEN they SHALL not fail the build process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Docker build to optimize for production deployment, so that the resulting image is efficient and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL exclude development dependencies
2. WHEN creating the final image THEN only necessary files SHALL be included
3. WHEN optimizing the build THEN multi-stage builds SHALL be used to minimize image size
4. WHEN building THEN build cache SHALL be utilized effectively to speed up subsequent builds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling in the Docker build process, so that build failures are easy to diagnose and fix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build errors occur THEN they SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
2. WHEN dependencies fail to install THEN the system SHALL provide specific troubleshooting guidance
3. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL indicate which files are missing or inaccessible
4. WHEN builds fail THEN logs SHALL include sufficient context for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Docker build to work consistently across different host environments, so that "works on my machine" issues are eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building on different operating systems THEN the build SHALL produce identical results
2. WHEN using different Docker versions THEN the build SHALL remain compatible
3. WHEN building with different resource constraints THEN the build SHALL adapt appropriately
4. WHEN network conditions vary THEN the build SHALL handle connectivity issues gracefully
