# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification focuses on delivering the core foundational services for the No Drake in the House platform and establishing a robust operational development environment. Rather than building the full feature set immediately, this phase concentrates on the essential backend services, authentication system, basic DNP list management, and a complete local development and Kubernetes deployment pipeline that will support future feature development.

The goal is to create a solid foundation with proper development workflows, testing infrastructure, and deployment automation that enables rapid iteration on features in subsequent phases.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage a personal Do-Not-Play list, so that I can track artists I want to avoid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for an artist THEN the system SHALL return results from a local artist database with basic metadata
2. WHEN a user adds an artist to their DNP list THEN the system SHALL store the association with optional tags and notes
3. WHEN a user views their DNP list THEN the system SHALL display all blocked artists with search and filter capabilities
4. WHEN a user removes an artist from their DNP list THEN the system SHALL immediately update the list and confirm the change
5. IF a user attempts to add a duplicate artist THEN the system SHALL prevent the duplicate and show the existing entry

### Requirement 5: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing infrastructure, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL execute unit tests for all service modules with minimum 80% code coverage
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL test complete API workflows using a test database
3. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL complete within 60 seconds for the core services
4. WHEN code is committed THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL run linting, formatting, and basic tests automatically
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and prevent deployment

### Requirement 6: Observability and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper observability and monitoring, so that I can debug issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL expose health check endpoints at `/health` with detailed status information
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL log structured JSON logs with correlation IDs
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with full context including stack traces and request details
4. WHEN services run THEN they SHALL expose Prometheus metrics for key performance indicators
5. IF services become unhealthy THEN health checks SHALL fail and provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 7: Database Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated database management, so that I can easily manage schema changes and data migrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database migrations are created THEN they SHALL be versioned and include both up and down migration scripts
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL automatically run pending migrations in the correct order
3. WHEN migrations fail THEN the system SHALL rollback to the previous state and provide clear error messages
4. WHEN in development mode THEN developers SHALL be able to reset the database with `make reset-db`
5. IF migration conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prevent startup and require manual resolution

### Requirement 8: Docker Build Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized Docker builds with multi-stage caching, so that I can iterate quickly without waiting for long build times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker images are built THEN they SHALL use multi-stage builds with optimal layer caching to minimize rebuild time
2. WHEN only source code changes THEN dependency layers SHALL be reused from cache, reducing build time by at least 80%
3. WHEN using Tilt with minikube THEN Docker builds SHALL complete in under 30 seconds for incremental changes
4. WHEN building for the first time THEN the system SHALL pre-warm build caches to optimize subsequent builds
5. IF build cache becomes stale THEN the system SHALL provide commands to refresh and optimize the cache

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an enhanced Tiltfile configuration, so that I can have the fastest possible development feedback loop with Kubernetes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Tilt THEN it SHALL automatically detect file changes and rebuild only affected services within 10 seconds
2. WHEN services are deployed THEN Tilt SHALL provide real-time logs and status updates in an intuitive dashboard
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN Tilt SHALL support manual triggers for tests, migrations, and health checks
4. WHEN multiple developers work on the project THEN Tilt configuration SHALL be consistent and reproducible across environments
5. IF services fail to start THEN Tilt SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested remediation steps

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want a fully functional frontend and backend application, so that I can actually use the DNP list management features through a working web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the frontend at localhost:5000 THEN I SHALL see a working login page that connects to the backend API
2. WHEN I register a new account THEN the frontend SHALL successfully communicate with the backend and create my user account
3. WHEN I log in with valid credentials THEN I SHALL be redirected to a functional dashboard showing my DNP lists
4. WHEN I search for artists THEN the frontend SHALL display real-time search results from the backend API
5. WHEN I add an artist to my DNP list THEN the change SHALL be persisted in the database and reflected in the UI immediately

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end application functionality working in both local and Kubernetes environments, so that I can verify the complete system works before deploying to production.
