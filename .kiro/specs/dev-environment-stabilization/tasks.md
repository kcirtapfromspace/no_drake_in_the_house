  - Update backend and frontend deployments to use ConfigMap and Secret references
  - Configure CORS settings to allow Tilt port-forwarded frontend access
  - Set VITE_API_URL to use localhost:3000 for Tilt port-forwarding
  - _Requirements: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5_

- [ ] 4. Fix port conflict resolution and namespace isolation
  - Update Tilt configuration to use configurable port forwarding
  - Implement port conflict detection with clear error messages and resolution guidance
  - Add environment variable support for configurable service ports
  - Create per-developer namespace support to avoid multi-developer conflicts
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 5. Resolve frontend UI rendering issues
  - Fix oversized password validation icons by updating CSS classes
  - Implement proper responsive design for form elements using Tailwind utilities
  - Add component-scoped styling to prevent CSS conflicts
  - Test registration form rendering across different screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement comprehensive health checks and readiness probes
  - Add proper readiness probes to all Kubernetes deployments
  - Implement backend health check endpoint that verifies database connectivity
  - Add frontend health check that confirms static assets are served correctly
  - Create Tilt manual trigger for comprehensive health validation across all services
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_

- [x] 7. Fix user registration flow and error handling
  - Debug and fix 500 errors in registration endpoint
  - Fix frontend registration success handling to properly auto-login users with returned tokens
  - Implement proper validation error responses for duplicate emails
  - Add frontend error handling for backend connectivity issues
  - Test complete registration flow from frontend form submission to database storage and auto-login
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [ ] 8. Create development workflow automation and manual triggers
  - Implement Tilt manual triggers for database operations (migrate, seed, reset)
  - Add testing triggers for backend, frontend, and complete test suite
  - Create service status and monitoring triggers for development debugging
  - Implement cleanup and maintenance triggers for Docker images and failed pods
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 5.5, 8.5_

- [ ] 9. Write comprehensive setup documentation and prerequisite checking
  - Create step-by-step setup guide for new developers
  - Implement prerequisite detection script for required tools (Rust, Node.js, kubectl, minikube, tilt)
  - Document troubleshooting solutions for common development environment issues
  - Add clear instructions for accessing services and understanding the development workflow
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5_

- [ ] 10. Validate and test complete development environment
  - Test complete environment setup from scratch on clean system
  - Validate that all services start correctly and dependencies are resolved
  - Test user registration flow end-to-end to ensure 500 errors are resolved
  - Verify that code changes trigger proper live updates without full rebuilds
  - Confirm that multiple developers can run isolated environments simultaneously
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_
