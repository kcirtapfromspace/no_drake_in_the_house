- **RateLimitState**: Current rate limiting state tracking
- **CircuitBreakerState**: Circuit breaker implementation for failure handling
- **BatchConfig**: Optimal batching configurations per operation type
- **BatchCheckpoint**: Resumable batch processing with checkpoints

#### 2. Rate Limiting Service (`src/services/rate_limiting.rs`)
- **Core Features**:
  - Provider-specific rate limit tracking using Redis
  - Circuit breaker pattern with automatic recovery
  - Exponential backoff with jitter
  - Optimal batch size calculation based on current rate limits
  - Resumable batch processing with checkpoints

- **Key Methods**:
  - `can_proceed()`: Check if requests can proceed
  - `wait_for_rate_limit()`: Smart waiting with minimum delays
  - `record_success()/record_failure()`: Update rate limit state
  - `create_optimal_batches()`: Create batches based on provider limits
  - `execute_batches()`: Execute batches with rate limiting

#### 3. Database Schema (`migrations/003_rate_limiting_and_jobs.sql`)
- **Tables Created**:
  - `provider_rate_state`: Current rate limiting state
  - `circuit_breaker_state`: Circuit breaker status
  - `batch_checkpoints`: Resumable processing checkpoints
  - `rate_limit_configs`: Provider configurations
  - `batch_configs`: Optimal batching settings

- **Default Configurations**:
  - Spotify: 100 req/min, 25 optimal batch size
  - Apple Music: 1000 req/hour, 15 optimal batch size
  - YouTube Music: 100 req/min, 1 item batches
  - Tidal: 200 req/min, 20 optimal batch size

## Task 8.2: Background Job Processing with Redis Queues ✅

### Components Implemented

#### 1. Job Queue Models (in `src/services/job_queue.rs`)
- **Job**: Complete job definition with progress tracking
- **JobType**: Enum for different job types (enforcement, rollback, etc.)
- **JobStatus**: Job lifecycle states (pending, processing, completed, etc.)
- **JobProgress**: Detailed progress tracking with estimates
- **WorkerConfig**: Worker configuration and capabilities

#### 2. Job Queue Service (`src/services/job_queue.rs`)
- **Core Features**:
  - Redis-based job queues with priority ordering
  - Background worker processes with configurable concurrency
  - Job retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Dead letter queue for failed jobs
  - Real-time progress tracking and user notifications

- **Key Methods**:
  - `enqueue_job()`: Add jobs to priority queues
  - `start_worker()`: Launch background worker processes
  - `get_job_status()`: Real-time job status and progress
  - `retry_job()`: Retry failed jobs with backoff
  - `cleanup_jobs()`: Automatic cleanup of old jobs

#### 3. Job Handlers (`src/services/enforcement_job_handler.rs`)
- **EnforcementJobHandler**: Handles enforcement execution jobs
- **RollbackJobHandler**: Handles batch rollback operations
- **TokenRefreshJobHandler**: Handles token refresh jobs

- **Features**:
  - Progress tracking with detailed steps
  - Integration with rate limiting service
  - Checkpoint-based resumable processing
  - Error handling and retry logic

### Integration Points

#### 1. Main Application (`src/main.rs`)
- Added rate limiting and job queue services to AppState
- Registered job handlers for different job types
- Started background worker processes
- Added new API endpoints for job management

#### 2. New API Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/jobs`: List user jobs with filtering
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/:job_id`: Get job status and progress
- `POST /api/v1/jobs/:job_id/retry`: Retry failed jobs
- `POST /api/v1/jobs/queue`: Enqueue new jobs
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/workers/stats`: Worker statistics
- `GET /api/v1/rate-limits/:provider/status`: Rate limit status

#### 3. Dependencies Added
- `redis = "0.24"`: Redis client for job queues and rate limiting
- `deadpool-redis = "0.14"`: Connection pooling for Redis
- `async-trait = "0.1"`: Async trait support for job handlers

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Rate Limiting Framework
- **Provider-specific configurations** with different limits per service
- **Circuit breaker pattern** to prevent cascading failures
- **Exponential backoff** with jitter to avoid thundering herd
- **Optimal batching** based on current rate limit state
- **Resumable processing** with checkpoints for long-running operations

### 2. Job Processing System
- **Priority-based queuing** with different priority levels
- **Background workers** with configurable concurrency
- **Retry logic** with exponential backoff and dead letter queues
- **Progress tracking** with real-time updates and estimates
- **Job lifecycle management** from creation to completion

### 3. Monitoring and Observability
- **Worker statistics** showing health and performance
- **Job progress tracking** with detailed step information
- **Rate limit monitoring** showing current state and capacity
- **Error tracking** with categorization and retry counts

## Testing

### 1. Unit Tests (`tests/rate_limiting_tests.rs`)
- Circuit breaker state transitions
- Batch checkpoint functionality
- Rate limit configuration builders
- Optimal batching algorithms

### 2. Integration Tests (`tests/job_queue_tests.rs`)
- Job creation and status tracking
- Priority-based job ordering
- Mock job handler implementations
- Worker configuration validation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string (default: redis://localhost:6379)
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection for persistent storage

### Default Settings
- **Worker concurrency**: 2 jobs per worker
- **Poll interval**: 1 second
- **Max execution time**: 10 minutes per job
- **Heartbeat interval**: 30 seconds
- **Job retention**: 24 hours for completed jobs

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Reliability

- **Worker health** monitoring and statistics
- **Rate limit status** visibility for capacity planning
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging and monitoring

## Requirements Satisfied
