# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current user interface of the "No Drake in the House" music streaming blocklist manager has several UX issues that negatively impact user experience. Most critically, icon images are scaling to fill all available browser space, making the interface unusable and unprofessional. Additionally, the application lacks consistent visual hierarchy, proper responsive design, and accessible interaction patterns. This feature will establish a polished, professional user interface with proper icon sizing, consistent design system implementation, and responsive layouts that work across all device sizes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want icons to be appropriately sized and positioned, so that the interface is usable and professional-looking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN all icons SHALL be constrained to their intended sizes and not scale to fill browser space
2. WHEN icons are displayed in different contexts (buttons, lists, headers) THEN they SHALL use consistent, appropriate sizing for each context
3. WHEN the browser window is resized THEN icons SHALL maintain their proper proportions and not become oversized
4. WHEN icons are used for interactive elements THEN they SHALL have appropriate hover and focus states
5. IF an icon lacks proper size constraints THEN the design system SHALL provide fallback sizing to prevent oversized display

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent visual hierarchy throughout the application, so that I can easily understand the interface structure and navigate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN headings SHALL follow a consistent hierarchy (H1, H2, H3) with appropriate sizing and spacing
2. WHEN interacting with buttons THEN they SHALL have consistent styling, sizing, and states across the application
3. WHEN viewing form elements THEN they SHALL follow consistent styling patterns for inputs, labels, and validation states
4. WHEN content is grouped THEN it SHALL use consistent card layouts, spacing, and visual separation
5. IF new components are added THEN they SHALL automatically inherit the established design system patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes, so that I can use the application on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately without horizontal scrolling
2. WHEN viewing on tablet devices THEN the interface SHALL optimize for touch interactions and medium screen sizes
3. WHEN viewing on desktop devices THEN the interface SHALL take advantage of larger screen real estate effectively
4. WHEN the viewport changes THEN navigation elements SHALL adapt (hamburger menu on mobile, full nav on desktop)
5. IF content doesn't fit the viewport THEN it SHALL reflow gracefully rather than breaking the layout

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the interface to follow accessibility best practices, so that I can use the application effectively with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN all interactive elements SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard only THEN all functionality SHALL be accessible via keyboard navigation
3. WHEN viewing with high contrast needs THEN color combinations SHALL meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
4. WHEN icons convey meaning THEN they SHALL have text alternatives or be marked as decorative appropriately
5. IF focus indicators are needed THEN they SHALL be clearly visible and follow consistent patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth, intuitive interactions throughout the application, so that using the platform feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking buttons or links THEN they SHALL provide immediate visual feedback (hover, active states)
2. WHEN forms are submitted THEN loading states SHALL be clearly indicated with appropriate spinners or progress indicators
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed with clear, actionable messaging and appropriate visual styling
4. WHEN content is loading THEN skeleton screens or loading states SHALL prevent layout shifts
5. IF animations are used THEN they SHALL be subtle, purposeful, and respect user preferences for reduced motion

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent spacing and layout throughout the application, so that the interface feels cohesive and well-designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing different pages THEN spacing between elements SHALL follow a consistent scale (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.)
2. WHEN content is displayed in containers THEN padding and margins SHALL be consistent across similar components
3. WHEN lists or grids are shown THEN item spacing SHALL be uniform and appropriate for the content type
4. WHEN forms are displayed THEN field spacing and grouping SHALL follow consistent patterns
5. IF new layouts are created THEN they SHALL automatically use the established spacing system

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback for all interactive states, so that I understand what elements I can interact with and their current status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN they SHALL provide clear visual feedback indicating interactivity
2. WHEN elements are disabled THEN they SHALL be visually distinct and clearly non-interactive
3. WHEN elements are selected or active THEN they SHALL have distinct visual states that are easy to identify
4. WHEN form validation occurs THEN success and error states SHALL be clearly differentiated with color and iconography
5. IF elements have multiple states THEN each state SHALL be visually distinct and meaningful to users

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the color scheme and typography to be professional and easy to read, so that I can use the application comfortably for extended periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading text content THEN typography SHALL be legible with appropriate font sizes, line heights, and contrast
2. WHEN viewing the interface THEN colors SHALL follow a cohesive palette that supports the application's purpose
3. WHEN distinguishing between different types of content THEN color coding SHALL be consistent and meaningful
4. WHEN viewing in different lighting conditions THEN the interface SHALL remain readable and usable
5. IF users have color vision differences THEN information SHALL not rely solely on color to convey meaning

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive design system with reusable components, so that I can build consistent interfaces efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building new features THEN pre-built components SHALL be available for common UI patterns
2. WHEN styling components THEN CSS classes SHALL follow a consistent naming convention and organization
3. WHEN design tokens change THEN updates SHALL propagate automatically throughout the application
4. WHEN new components are needed THEN they SHALL be built to integrate seamlessly with the existing design system
5. IF design inconsistencies are found THEN the design system SHALL provide tools to identify and resolve them

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to perform well visually, so that interactions feel smooth and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scrolling through content THEN the interface SHALL maintain smooth 60fps performance
2. WHEN images or icons load THEN they SHALL not cause layout shifts or visual jumps
3. WHEN animations play THEN they SHALL be optimized for performance and not block user interactions
4. WHEN the application starts THEN critical above-the-fold content SHALL render quickly
5. IF performance issues occur THEN the design system SHALL provide optimized alternatives for better performance
