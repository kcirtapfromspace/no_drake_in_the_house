# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Guidelines

The icons should:
- Use the Kiro brand colors (green: #1db954)
- Be recognizable at small sizes
- Include a music/audio theme
- Have a transparent background
- Be optimized for web use

## Temporary Placeholder

For development, you can use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files as placeholders.
The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience.

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
- Figma
- GIMP (free)
- Online icon generators

Make sure to export in PNG format with transparent backgrounds.
