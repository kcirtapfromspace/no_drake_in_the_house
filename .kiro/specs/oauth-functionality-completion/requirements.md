# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature completes the OAuth functionality implementation by replacing placeholder responses and "temporarily disabled" methods with fully functional OAuth authentication flows. The current OAuth infrastructure exists but many core methods return placeholder responses or are disabled, preventing actual OAuth authentication from working properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete OAuth Service Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OAuth service methods to be fully implemented so that users can actually authenticate using Google, Apple, and GitHub OAuth providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates an OAuth flow THEN the system SHALL generate real authorization URLs with proper OAuth parameters
2. WHEN OAuth callback is received THEN the system SHALL exchange authorization codes for actual access tokens from OAuth providers
3. WHEN OAuth tokens are obtained THEN the system SHALL securely store them using AES-GCM encryption in the token vault
4. WHEN user info is retrieved THEN the system SHALL fetch actual user profile data from OAuth providers
5. WHEN OAuth accounts are linked THEN the system SHALL properly associate them with existing user accounts in the database
6. WHEN OAuth tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them using stored refresh tokens
7. WHEN OAuth accounts are unlinked THEN the system SHALL properly remove the association and revoke tokens

### Requirement 2: OAuth Provider Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using real OAuth providers (Google, Apple, GitHub) so that I can access the application using my existing social accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL integrate with Google's OAuth2 endpoints and retrieve user profile information
2. WHEN using Apple Sign In THEN the system SHALL handle Apple's JWT-based authentication and privacy features
3. WHEN using GitHub OAuth THEN the system SHALL integrate with GitHub's OAuth API and retrieve user email and profile data
4. WHEN OAuth provider credentials are configured THEN the system SHALL validate them before use
5. IF OAuth provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful error handling and fallback options
6. WHEN OAuth scopes are requested THEN the system SHALL request appropriate permissions for user profile and email access
7. WHEN OAuth state parameters are used THEN the system SHALL validate them to prevent CSRF attacks

### Requirement 3: Database Integration for OAuth Accounts

**User Story:** As a system, I want to properly store and manage OAuth account associations so that users can link multiple providers and maintain their authentication state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth account is created THEN the system SHALL store it in the oauth_accounts table with encrypted tokens
2. WHEN user has multiple OAuth accounts THEN the system SHALL properly link them to the same user profile
3. WHEN OAuth tokens are refreshed THEN the system SHALL update the stored encrypted tokens in the database
4. WHEN OAuth account is unlinked THEN the system SHALL remove the database record and clean up associated data
5. WHEN user merges accounts THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail in account_merges table
6. WHEN querying OAuth accounts THEN the system SHALL efficiently retrieve them using proper database indexes
7. WHEN OAuth account data is accessed THEN the system SHALL decrypt tokens only when needed for API calls

### Requirement 4: Token Management and Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious system, I want OAuth tokens to be properly encrypted, refreshed, and managed so that user authentication remains secure and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using AES-GCM with proper key management
2. WHEN tokens are near expiration THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them using refresh tokens
3. WHEN refresh tokens are used THEN the system SHALL update both access and refresh tokens in storage
4. WHEN tokens cannot be refreshed THEN the system SHALL notify users to re-authenticate
5. WHEN tokens are revoked THEN the system SHALL handle authorization errors gracefully
6. WHEN encryption keys are rotated THEN the system SHALL re-encrypt existing tokens with new keys
7. WHEN token vault is accessed THEN the system SHALL use proper authentication and authorization

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and smooth OAuth flows so that authentication issues are easy to understand and resolve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth flow fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the cause
2. WHEN OAuth provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with retry options
3. WHEN OAuth tokens are invalid THEN the system SHALL prompt users to re-authenticate
4. WHEN account linking conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide resolution options to users
5. WHEN OAuth state validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent CSRF attacks and log security events
6. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and inform users
7. WHEN OAuth callback contains errors THEN the system SHALL parse and display provider-specific error messages

### Requirement 6: Account Management Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my linked OAuth accounts so that I can add, remove, and view my connected social authentication providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing account settings THEN the system SHALL display all linked OAuth providers with connection status
2. WHEN linking additional OAuth account THEN the system SHALL associate it with the current user account
3. WHEN unlinking OAuth account THEN the system SHALL remove the association and provide confirmation
4. WHEN multiple accounts exist for same provider THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts appropriately
5. WHEN primary authentication method is removed THEN the system SHALL ensure user retains access to account
6. WHEN account merge is needed THEN the system SHALL provide guided merge workflow
7. WHEN OAuth account data changes THEN the system SHALL update local profile information on next login
